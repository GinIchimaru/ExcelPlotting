# ExcelPlotting
User defined functions for calling some special types of charts from excel cell. 

## Mission statement:
*To have a relatively convenient and easy way to obtain some non standard charts in excel and to keep the ability build on them more complex solutions without loosing on flexibility*

## Prolog
The library is an Excel add-in file called Plotting.xlam. After you install this add-in ([Plotting.xml](https://github.com/GinIchimaru/ExcelPlotting/blob/master/Plotting.xlam)) the usual way, you can open TEST.xlsm and go through some of the examples.

In addition, I plan to write a few *wordy* tutorials which, at the time being, I will be posting as a LinkedIn articles. As of writing this you can check next tutorials/articles:
